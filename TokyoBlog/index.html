                            <p>The night was dark.  The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.</p>

                            <p>It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives.  Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide.  They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside.  Passepartout and the guide stopped.  Had they been heard?  Was the alarm being given?</p>

                            <p>Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis.  They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay.  But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work.  They could not now reach the victim; how, then, could they save her?  Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage.  The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.</p>

                            <p>In this way, with ten warriors, I built a series of three steps from the ground to the shoulders of the topmost man.  Then starting from a short distance behind them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the next, and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest I clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broad expanse.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an equal number of my warriors.  These lengths we had previously fastened together, and passing one end to the topmost warrior I lowered the other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below.  No one was in sight, so, lowering myself to the end of my leather strap, I dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavement below.</p>

                            <p>Now that we were before Zodanga the task of obtaining entry to the city devolved upon me, and directing Tars Tarkas to hold his forces in two divisions out of earshot of the city, with each division opposite a large gateway, I took twenty dismounted warriors and approached one of the small gates that pierced the walls at short intervals.  These gates have no regular guard, but are covered by sentries, who patrol the avenue that encircles the city just within the walls as our metropolitan police patrol their beats.</p>

                            <p>The walls of Zodanga are seventy-five feet in height and fifty feet thick.  They are built of enormous blocks of carborundum, and the task of entering the city seemed, to my escort of green warriors, an impossibility.  The fellows who had been detailed to accompany me were of one of the smaller hordes, and therefore did not know me.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Placing three of them with their faces to the wall and arms locked, I commanded two more to mount to their shoulders, and a sixth I ordered to climb upon the shoulders of the upper two.  The head of the topmost warrior towered over forty feet from the ground.</p>

                            <p>The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.</p>
